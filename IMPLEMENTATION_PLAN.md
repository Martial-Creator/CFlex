## 🔄 Order Workflow Implementation

### Workflow States
1. **New** → Order submitted
2. **Claimed** → Staff assigned
3. **Design In Progress** → Creating/uploading proof
4. **Awaiting Client Review** → Client notified
5. **Changes Requested** → Revisions needed
6. **Approved** → Digital sign-off received
7. **In Production** → Printing/manufacturing
8. **Ready for Collection** → Invoice generated
9. **Closed** → Payment complete

### Auto-Transitions
- Upload proof → Awaiting Client Review
- Client approval → Approved status
- Mark ready → Invoice generation
- Payment recorded → Closed

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Critical Risks
1. **WhatsApp Proxy Instability**
   - Primary: Email fallback for all messages
   - Secondary: In-app notifications
   - Long-term: Official WhatsApp Business API

2. **Storage Limitations**
   - Hot storage on VPS (100GB)
   - Cold storage on cPanel (1.5TB)
   - Archive strategy for old files
   - Future: S3-compatible storage (MinIO)

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Queue-based processing for heavy tasks
   - CDN for static assets
   - Database read replicas
   - Horizontal scaling ready
