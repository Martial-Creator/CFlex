 Reasoning:
 Built on Node.js/NestJS - modern, scalable architecture
 Modular design allows custom module addition
 Built-in multi-tenant support for organizations
 Active development with printing-relevant features
 GraphQL API for efficient data fetching
 Lower resource requirements than Odoo/ERPNext
 Implementation Strategy:
 javascript
 2. Storage Architecture (Hybrid Approach)
