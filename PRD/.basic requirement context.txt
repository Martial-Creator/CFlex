Product Requirement Document: Caldron Flex All-in-One Business Management System
Document Version: 2.0
Date: July 9, 2025
Author: Product Requirement Analysis Officer
Status: Refined Draft for Final Review

1. Executive Summary
This document details the definitive requirements for a custom-built, all-in-one web application for Caldron Flex. The system is designed to digitize and automate the entire business workflow, from client onboarding and order management to production, invoicing, and customer relations.
The strategic decision has been made to build the system with Ever Gauzy as the core ERP "brain," integrating it with Bagisto for e-commerce. This refined strategy aims to create a cohesive and powerful platform by modifying and extending these open-source solutions. The primary goals remain to boost operational efficiency, elevate the customer experience, and establish a scalable foundation for future growth, all while adhering to specified technical and business constraints.

2. Project Vision & Scope
2.1. Vision
To create a singular, unified digital hub that manages every facet of the printing business lifecycle. The platform will serve as the central nervous system for Caldron Flex, automating critical workflows, providing complete transparency into operations, and empowering staff to deliver exceptional service.
2.2. Scope
In-Scope:
* Centralized Order & Production Workflow: A complete system for managing custom print jobs from initial client submission, through design, a robust client proofing/correction cycle, approval, and final invoicing.
* Advanced Client Management (CRM): A sophisticated system to manage Organizations (with internal member hierarchies and permissions), registered Individuals, and temporary Guest customers.
* Product & Pricing Management (PIM): A dynamic catalog of all products and services with support for attribute-based pricing (e.g., per square foot), variant pricing, and manual quoting for custom jobs.
* Integrated E-commerce Storefront: A dedicated storefront powered by Bagisto on the store.caldronflex.com.np subdomain, for selling standardized, ready-to-ship items.
* Core Business Operations: Essential modules for inventory management (supporting both raw materials and finished goods), purchasing, and financial tracking (invoicing, credit management, and payment status).
* Automated Multichannel Communication: Automated notifications to clients via email and a self-hosted WhatsApp proxy server.
* Interactive Design Proofing & File Management: A secure and user-friendly workflow for handling various design file formats, generating web-previews, and capturing client feedback through an annotation tool.
Out-of-Scope (for Initial Version):
* Direct Online Payment Gateways: All payments will be managed offline via cash or cheque. The system's role is to generate invoices and track payment status.
* Advanced Accounting Suite: The system will not perform complex accounting functions like tax filing or generating official financial statements. Tax calculation will be a configurable feature on invoices.
* Automated Quality Control Checkpoints & Production Tracking: Detailed real-time tracking of the physical printing process is not required for the initial version.
* Automated Shipping & Logistics Integration: The system will mark orders as "Ready for Collection" for in-person pickup only.

3. User Roles & Personas (Refined)
1. System Administrator: Super-user with unrestricted access. Manages platform settings, core configurations, and all user accounts and roles.
2. Staff (Admin): The primary operational manager. Has full access to all business modules (projects, clients, invoicing, inventory). Can create and configure access levels for other staff members.
3. Staff (Helper): A general staff member with restricted access. Their permissions (e.g., view tasks, upload designs, update status) are configurable by the Staff Admin. Initially, there will be one Admin and one Helper.
4. Client (Organization Admin): The main contact for a business client. Can create projects, manage their organization's members, define member permissions (e.g., "Can Submit Tasks," "Can Approve Designs"), and view all organizational activity.
5. Client (Organization Member): A user under an organization with permissions granted by their Admin.
6. Client (Individual): A registered customer who manages their own projects and profile.
7. Client (Guest/Temporary): A one-time customer who can place an order using minimal information (Name and Phone Number).

4. System Architecture & Technical Strategy (Refined)
4.1. Open-Source Foundation
The technical strategy is now focused and streamlined:
* Core Framework/ERP: Ever Gauzy will serve as the "brain" of the operation. It will be heavily customized to handle the core CRM, project management, PIM, and inventory logic. The system will be built on top of and extended from Ever Gauzy's framework.
* E-commerce: Bagisto (Laravel-based) will exclusively power the store.caldronflex.com.np subdomain. A robust API will be developed to ensure two-way synchronization of customers, inventory, and orders between Bagisto and Ever Gauzy to maintain a single source of truth.
* Feature Inspiration: UI/UX concepts and specific workflow ideas from Rise CRM and Twenty CRM will be used as inspiration for building out the custom front-end on Ever Gauzy, rather than attempting a technical integration.
4.2. Deployment & Hosting
* Environment: The application stack must be deployable on a cPanel hosting environment without Docker support.
* Initial Server Specs: The target deployment environment has 3GB RAM, 1.5TB Storage, and unmetered bandwidth.
* Strategy: This is a significant constraint. The development will need to be optimized for this specific environment. The use of a separate cPanel account purely for file storage is a viable strategy to manage large design files, with the main application residing on the primary account.
* Future Scalability: The client acknowledges that as the business grows, a migration to a more robust Virtual Private Server (VPS) will be considered.

5. Functional Requirements & Features (Refined)
5.1. Workflow Automation: The Core Printing Process
This workflow remains the heart of the system, with the following clarifications:
* Task Assignment: Tasks entering the "New" queue can be claimed by any available staff member. There is no manual assignment by a manager.
* Quoting for Custom Jobs: For items like "Holding Boards," the client will either consult in the office or submit requirements through the portal. A staff member will then manually create a configured project with a fixed price within the system, effectively bypassing the initial client submission step.
5.2. Design Proofing & Version Control
* Supported File Formats: The system will accept a wide range of design files, including TIFF, JPEG, PDF, SVG, PSD, and PNG, with a maximum upload size of 500MB. Clients can also upload reference images with their orders.
* Annotation Tool: The web-based tool will allow clients to place pins and add simple comments to highlight required changes on the JPG preview.
* Version Control: The system will not store a new TIFF file for every revision. Instead, it will store the initial version of the design file. Subsequent corrections will be stored as a list of comments and annotations linked to that version. The designer will work off the original file and this list of changes.
5.3. Inventory Management (Mixed Model)
* Logic: Inventory will be managed using a mixed model. 
o Finished Goods Level: For products like flex banners where the raw material (roll) is converted into a custom-sized final product, inventory will be tracked at the finished good level (e.g., tracking the output, not the input roll).
o Raw Material & Finished Goods Level: For other products sold after configuration (e.g., frames, medals), the system will track both the raw components and the final configured items.
* Pricing: Inventory levels will not be used for automatic price calculation.
* Alerts: The system will warn staff when materials are out of stock.
5.4. Financial & Customer Management
* Tax Calculation: Tax (e.g., GST/VAT) must be a configurable feature that can be added to invoices.
* Partial Payments: The system will handle partial payments by logging the amount paid and showing the remaining "amount due" on the invoice.
* Customer Credit: A credit management feature is required for trusted organizational clients, allowing them to complete projects and pay via cheque at the end.
* Refunds/Cancellations: No refund mechanism is required, as the client's approval of the final proof is considered binding.
5.5. Multilingual Support & API
* Language: The entire user-facing interface (both client and staff portals) must support both English and Nepali.
* API Access: An API must be available to allow for potential future integrations with other systems.

6. Questions for Final Client Clarification
Your detailed feedback has been invaluable. Here are the final key questions to ensure perfect alignment before development begins:
A. On Business & Workflow Logic:
1. Design Revisions: You mentioned allowing up to 5 design revisions. Should the system enforce this limit automatically, or is it just a guideline for staff?only guidance for staff
2. Urgent Orders: How should the system visually distinguish or prioritize a "rush order"? Should there be a specific "urgent" flag that staff can set, which places the task at the top of the queue?yes
3. Customer Complaints: For the complaint/ticket system, what is the exact workflow? Does a client ticket automatically pause a project? What are the typical resolution steps?(consider your best solution ad apply it)
4. Credit Management: For clients on credit, should the system have a configurable credit limit for each organization to prevent exceeding a certain amount of unpaid work?no,not needed
B. On Product & Pricing Details:
5. Medal Variants: For metal medals, you noted they are sold as a G/S/B set but should also be configurable to be sold individually. For individual sale, should each color (Gold, Silver, Bronze) have a potentially different price, or will they be the same?same price
6. Seasonal Pricing: You confirmed a need for seasonal/promotional pricing. How should this work? Should it be a manual discount code, or should the system allow you to set specific date ranges where certain products have a different price?it should have manual discount code for certain date range in certain product(canbe postpone to next version)
C. On Technical & User Experience:
7. Staff Permissions (Helper Role): Can you provide a specific list of actions the "Staff Helper" should and should not be able to do initially? (e.g., Can view tasks? Can upload files? Can communicate with clients? Can view financial data?)they have all the access to the functionality except for purchase price
8. AR/VR Timeline: You mentioned the AR/VR preview is planned for "this year." Can you confirm if this is a hard requirement for the initial launch, or if it can be a fast-follow feature in Phase 2? This has significant technical implications.(the ar/vr view feature is already in bagisto just need to create the ar/vr type file of the products
9. WhatsApp Integration: You clarified using a "WhatsApp proxy server." To ensure reliability, it's strongly recommended to use the official WhatsApp Business API. Is the business prepared for the potential per-message costs associated with the official API to guarantee stable communication with clients?no

Of course. Based on the extensive details, client clarifications, and raw requirements you've provided, I have analyzed, consolidated, and improved the information into a single, cohesive Product Requirement Document (PRD). This revised document resolves architectural conflicts, incorporates your client's specific answers, and presents the project in a structured format ready for development planning.

Encouraged to create a full account.
4. System Architecture & Technical Strategy
4.1. Core Platform Strategy
To avoid the extreme complexity and instability of merging over six different platforms, this project will adopt a "core and satellite" architecture.
* Core System ("The Brain"): Ever Gauzy will be selected as the primary platform. It will be heavily customized to serve as the central database and logic handler for projects, CRM, and core business operations. Features and UI/UX concepts from Rise CRM and Twenty CRM will be used as inspiration for building custom modules within the Ever Gauzy framework, not integrated as separate systems.
* E-commerce Satellite: Bagisto will be used to power the public-facing e-commerce storefront at store.caldronflex.com.np. A robust, custom-built API will synchronize products, inventory, and customer data between Bagisto and the core Ever Gauzy system.
4.2. Subdomain Strategy
* app.caldronflex.com.np: The main portal for clients and staff to manage custom printing projects. This will be the interface for the customized Ever Gauzy system.
* store.caldronflex.com.np: The public-facing e-commerce storefront powered by Bagisto.
* Additional subdomains can be configured as needed for specific services (e.g., api.caldronflex.com.np).
4.3. Deployment & Hosting
* Initial Deployment: The application stack must be deployable on a cPanel hosting environment. This is a hard constraint for the initial launch. The development team must account for cPanel's limitations (e.g., no Docker support).
* Future Scalability: The client acknowledges that a Virtual Private Server (VPS) will be considered as the business grows. A proposed strategy is to use a VPS for application hosting (to handle the complex stack) and leverage a cost-effective cPanel plan primarily for large-volume file storage.
4.4. WhatsApp Integration
The system will integrate with a "self-hosted WhatsApp server." This implies using a proxy or an unofficial API. This poses a significant reliability risk. The architecture should include a fallback mechanism to email notifications if the WhatsApp service is interrupted. The use of the official WhatsApp Business API is the recommended long-term solution.

5. Functional Requirements & Features
5.1. Core Workflow & Project Management
* Task Queue: New tasks appear in a general queue where any available staff member can claim them.
* Automated Status Transitions: The system must automatically update a task's status based on user actions (e.g., submitting a proof changes status to "Awaiting Client Review").
* Priority Management: Task priority will be determined primarily by the client-specified deadline. Staff can manually manage rush orders.
* Hierarchical Projects: The system will support grouping multiple related tasks under a single "Project" entity.
5.2. Design Proofing & File Management
* File Support: The system will accept various design formats, including JPG, PDF, SVG, PSD, PNG, and TIFF.
* Automatic Preview: On upload of a source file (e.g., TIFF), the system must automatically generate a watermarked, low-resolution JPG preview for the client.
* Design Annotation Tool: The client interface must include a simple tool allowing users to place comments and highlight areas on the JPG preview to request corrections.
* Version Control: The system must store the client's initial file. For revisions, it will store the list of requested changes (comments and highlights). Storing every full-version iteration of the source TIFF file is not required.
* Client Reference Files: Clients must be able to upload reference images or documents when submitting a task.
5.3. Product & Pricing Management (PIM)
* Dynamic Pricing: The system will automatically calculate prices for products based on attributes (e.g., Rs./sq. ft. for banners).
* Custom Quotes: Products like "Holding Boards" will be flagged for manual quoting by staff within the system. Staff can create a quote, which, upon client approval (done offline), becomes a priced order.
* Price Overrides: Staff must have the permission to manually override system-calculated prices.
* Configurable Products: The system must allow administrators to configure complex products, such as a "Metal Medal" set that can be sold as a bundle (Gold/Silver/Bronze) or as individual items with different prices.
* Tax Calculation: The system must support a configurable tax rate (e.g., GST) that is applied to invoices.
5.4. Invoicing & Payments
* Automated Invoice Generation: An invoice is automatically generated and sent to the client when a task's status changes to "Ready for Collection."
* Payment Tracking: Staff can manually record payments (Cash or Cheque) against an invoice.
* Partial Payments: The system must handle partial payments, showing the remaining balance due on the invoice.
* Credit Management: The system will track credit offered to clients (especially organizations).
5.5. Inventory Management
* Mixed-Level Tracking: Inventory will be managed at both the raw material level (e.g., paper, frames) and the finished goods level (e.g., pre-made banners).
* Stock-Out Alerts: The system will warn staff when a task requires a material that is low in stock.
* No Material Costing for Pricing: Inventory levels will be for operational tracking only and will not be used to calculate the price of a finished product.
5.6. Administration & Reporting
* Configurable Roles & Permissions: The System Admin must have an interface to create and modify the permissions for all user roles, including granular controls for Staff Helpers and Client Organization members.
* Reporting Module: While not a primary focus for day-one, the system must have the foundational capability to generate operational reports (daily, weekly, monthly sales) and future customer analytics.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
CategoryRequirementPerformanceThe system must support ~30 concurrent users without significant degradation. Page loads and file operations should be responsive.SecuritySecure handling of client data and design files is critical. Standard security practices (e.g., input sanitization, authentication) must be followed. File access should be permission-based.BackupA daily backup of the database and application files must be performed automatically.UsabilityThe interface must be intuitive for both technical and non-technical users and must be fully functional in both English and Nepali.
